Installation
Just unzip the folder and run the .exe
It probably works
No : or , are needed to input the time, just write it as it is
0:06=6, 0:12=12, 1:03=103 etc
Capped to 10 stages for expanse
Dream run (should) keep the best split per room
Personal best run (should) have your PB and splits per stage
Enter the timer after the stage, hit enter or click add Stage x
end current run to reset or after you are done with 10 stages
Wipe All PBs-click yes twice to wipe both dream and pbs, click yes and no to keep dream splits
Probably dont need to press Re-read config unless you want to change colours or bg or smn
Runs and config are saved in json that comes with it
Change seasons and stages in the top left, STAGES button
Wipe all only impacts the current stage and season
If something needs to be manually adjusted (i.e. wrong total was inputted) just manually change it in the json

I forgot what else i wanted to mention so its probably not important
